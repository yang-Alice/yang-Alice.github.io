# Introduction

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. It allows developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing â€“ an approach known as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units). In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of setting up the CUDA development environment and running a simple "Hello World" program.
